# WGS Extract Development

This is the main **WGS Extract** Developers repository and support area for coders and others with a deeper understanding of the tool.  

See [WGS Extract Users](https://wgsextract.github.io/) for the main entry point for users. That is where to download a release and find documentation related to using the tool. 

See also [WGS Extract Historical](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Historical "WGSE Historical") for an archive of the original work and tool in 2019 by Marko before others started to get involved and help build on his initial body of work.

Within this area are the source code, build scripts and developer documentation for the tool. Including historical release notes.
